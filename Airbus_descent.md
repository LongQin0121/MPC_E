  # Getting to Grips with Aircraft Performance

  # DESCENT/Holding

  γ = Descent gradient

  RD = Rate of Descent (Vertical Speed) : The rate of descent (RD) represents the vertical component of the  aircraft’s speed. It is negative and expressed in feet per minute.

## 1.2 Descent Equations

While climb is due to excess thrust, descent is, on the other hand, caused by a lack of thrust. Therefore, the descent gradient and the rate of descent, which depend on the difference (Thrust – Drag), are negative.


### 1.2.1. Descent Gradient (γ)

```python
At a given weight, the magnitude of the descent gradient is minimum when the drag is minimum, or when the lift-to-drag ratio is maximum. The minimum descent angle speed is, therefore, green dot speed.
```

### 1.2.2. Rate of Descent (RD)

```
Conclusion: At a given aircraft weight, the rate of descent is minimum, when `TASxDrag` is minimum.
```

The example below (Figure H2) illustrates both thrust and drag forces, as opposed to True Air Speed.  The above equations indicate that, for a given weight:  • The descent angle (γ) is proportional to the drag force, which is at its  minimum at green dot speed.  • The rate of descent (RD) is proportional to the power of the drag force. As RD = TAS.γ, the minimum rate of descent is obtained for a TAS lower than  green dot (when dRD/dTAS = 0).
